### 🚀 What I've Built

During my internship, I delivered two end-to-end solutions — from zero to production — earning direct recognition from leadership for operational impact:

🔹 **NFe Automation** — Desktop app for Electronic Invoice processing: directory monitoring, XML validation, batch compression, and API submission. Runs as a Windows service with automatic failure recovery. **Eliminated hours of daily manual work.**

🔹 **Observability Stack** — Grafana, Loki, Promtail & Prometheus deployment for centralized logging and AWS server monitoring. Real-time dashboards that **reduced failure diagnosis from hours to minutes** and provided insights for cloud cost optimization.

### 🎓 Academic Highlight

**[Sophos Kodiak](REPO_LINK)** — AI-powered data analysis assistant built for a corporate challenge. Mobile app with Text-to-SQL logic via Google Gemini, converting natural language into structured database queries. Features chatbot interface and metrics dashboard.

> Built with Flutter, Python, SQLite & Supabase — new projects aligned with JavaScript/TypeScript are on the way.
