### 🚀 What I've Built

During my internship, I delivered two end-to-end solutions — from zero to production — earning direct recognition from leadership for operational impact:

**NFe Automation** — Desktop application for Electronic Invoice processing: directory monitoring, XML validation, batch compression, and API submission. Runs as a Windows service with automatic failure recovery, eliminating hours of daily manual processing.

**Observability Stack** — Grafana, Loki, Promtail, and Prometheus deployment for centralized logging and AWS server monitoring. Real-time alert dashboards that reduced failure diagnosis from hours to minutes.

### 🎓 Academic Highlight

**Sophos Kodiak** — AI-powered data analysis assistant (corporate challenge). Mobile app with Text-to-SQL logic via Google Gemini, converting natural language into structured queries. Includes chatbot interface and metrics dashboard.
